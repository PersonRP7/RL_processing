Streaming JSON input validator.

This module provides a streaming validation mechanism for JSON input,
specifically tailored for requests containing "first_names" and "last_names"
fields. It is designed to validate large JSON payloads incrementally as they
are received, without loading the entire content into memory.

The main class, `StreamingValidator`, allows feeding the incoming JSON data
chunk by chunk using the `feed()` method and finalizing validation with
`finish()`. On encountering invalid JSON structures or missing required fields,
it raises `InvalidInputError` immediately, enabling early termination of
processing and returning a 400-level HTTP response.

This approach is useful for:

- Streaming large JSON requests efficiently.
- Catching malformed input early before further processing.
- Decoupling validation logic from I/O or logging concerns.

Typical usage:

    from validators.input_validator import streaming_validator

    validator = streaming_validator()
    for chunk in request_stream:
        validator.feed(chunk)
    validator.finish()  # Raises error if any issues found

from services.name_processing import InvalidInputError


class StreamingValidator:
    """
    Incrementally validates incoming JSON
    while it's being written to a file.

    Raises InvalidInputError immediately on the first malformed chunk.

    def __init__(self):
        self._seen_first_names = False
        self._seen_last_names = False
        self._buffer = b""  # Buffer to hold partial chunks

    def feed(self, chunk: bytes):
        """
        Feed a chunk of bytes to the streaming JSON validator.

        This method allows the validator to process the request body in a streaming
        fashion, handling arbitrarily large JSON documents without reading them
        fully into memory. Incoming data may arrive in partial or incomplete chunks,
        so parsing errors from incomplete JSON are temporarily ignored until more
        data is fed.

        Args:
            chunk (bytes): A portion of the request body from the streaming request.

        Raises:
            InvalidInputError: If a complete structural element (e.g., a JSON array item)
                has been fully received and is invalid, or if the final JSON structure
                is malformed when `finish()` is called.

        Notes:
            - Partial or incomplete chunks are allowed because the validator cannot
            determine whether the JSON is truly malformed until enough data is available.
            - A complete structural element (like an array item) is considered "fully
            received" when all of its constituent tokens (start, values, end) are present.
            Only then is it validated. This ensures that the validator does not raise
            errors on chunks that merely contain incomplete JSON fragments.
            - The validator internally buffers chunks and only parses enough to
            validate complete elements, avoiding false positives on incomplete data.

        Complete validation after all chunks have been fed.

        This method should be called once all streaming JSON data has been
        provided via `feed()`. It finalizes the parsing of any remaining
        buffered data and performs top-level validation to ensure the input
        meets required structural expectations.

        Raises:
            InvalidInputError: If the JSON is malformed, or if the required
                top-level keys ('first_names' or 'last_names') are missing.
                This ensures that even if individual chunks were valid,
                the overall JSON structure is correct.

        Notes:

            - This is the point where missing required keys are detected,
              since they may not appear until the entire document has been
              streamed.
            - Any remaining partial elements in the buffer are parsed and
              validated here.
